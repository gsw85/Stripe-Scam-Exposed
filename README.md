# Stripe Scam Exposed

![Views](https://hits.dwyl.com/gsw85/Stripe-Scam-Exposed.svg?label=views)

A repository dedicated to exposing Stripe as a scam. This repository provides evidence, personal stories, and resources to inform users about the fraudulent practices allegedly conducted by Stripe. Many people receive the email titled "[Action required] Closure of your Stripe account for xxxx." When you receive this email, you will know that Stripe will keep your money and will never return it to you.

## This is my story
I recently started my first AI-based startup, providing image processing services such as prompt-to-create images like MidJourney. Additionally, my services include enlarging, deblurring, removing backgrounds, and replacing backgrounds.

While looking for a payment processor, Stripe approached me.

After consulting with their representatives, Stripe proposed their gateway to me (see attached pic).
I set up my account and had a Stripe representative check through it,
receiving assurance from Stripe that everything was in order.

Due to the publicity around AI and extensive marketing efforts, both online and offline, my business started to pick up, and I began receiving significant revenue.

Out of the blue, Stripe sent me a notice about account closure (as shown in pic).
They claimed that many of my transactions were high-risk and stated that they would no longer provide services to me.
Additionally, they informed me that my earnings would not be made available to me.

I consulted with the Stripe representatives who initially approached me,
and they told me that my account had risk control problems (as shown in pic).
Here is a quick overview of recent transactions from my Stripe account:
I never had any disputes, and failed transactions were due to users canceling payments.

When I asked Stripe what policy I was violating, I received no answer.
They didn't provide any reason for withholding my earnings, only emphasizing that my account had high-risk problems.
Since then, Stripe has ignored my messages,
and I have received no reply from their representatives or support team when trying to find a solution.

What else can I say?
Stripe is a real scam company.
My records show that I do not have any disputes and no problems on my client's side.
Despite this, they have withheld my earnings and stopped responding to my inquiries.
