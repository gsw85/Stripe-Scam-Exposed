# Stripe Scam Exposed

![Views](https://hits.dwyl.com/gsw85/Stripe-Scam-Exposed.svg?label=views)

A repository dedicated to exposing Stripe as a scam. This repository provides evidence, personal stories, and resources to inform users about the fraudulent practices allegedly conducted by Stripe. Many people receive the email titled "[Action required] Closure of your Stripe account for xxxx." When you receive this email, you will know that Stripe will keep your money and will never return it to you.

## This is my story
I recently started my first AI-based startup, providing image processing services such as prompt-to-create images like MidJourney. Additionally, my services include enlarging, deblurring, removing backgrounds, and replacing backgrounds.

While looking for a payment processor, Stripe approached me. After consulting with their representatives, Stripe proposed their gateway to me (see attached pic). I set up my account and had a Stripe representative check through it, receiving assurance from Stripe that everything was in order.
